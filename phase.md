## ✅ Reflection
Creating infrastructure with Terraform helped me understand the structure of cloud services better. The challenge was configuring the PostgreSQL service and getting network settings to allow access from the web app.

The manual deployment was tedious but insightful, especially pushing to Azure Container Registry and configuring the web app. Next time, I’d automate it earlier using GitHub Actions for better speed and reproducibility.
