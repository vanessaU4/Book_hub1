## ✅ Peer Review


## ✅ Reflection
Creating infrastructure with Terraform helped me understand the structure of cloud services better. The challenge was configuring the PostgreSQL service and getting network settings to allow access from the web app.

Although time-consuming, the manual deployment was instructive, particularly when it came to configuring the web application and pushing to the Azure Container Registry. For improved speed and reproducibility, I would use GitHub Actions to automate it earlier the next time.
